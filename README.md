**Healthcare Data Analysis**

Project Overview

This project analyzes a healthcare dataset using SQL to derive insights on patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital billing, and admission details. The dataset contains information about patients, doctors, hospitals, insurance providers, and medical treatments. The goal of the analysis is to provide valuable insights into patient care patterns and hospital operations.

Dataset Information

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- Name: Name of the patient.
- Age: Age of the patient.
- Gender: Gender of the patient.
- Blood Type: Blood type of the patient.
- Medical Condition: The patient's primary medical condition.
- Date of Admission: The date when the patient was admitted to the hospital.
- Doctor: The name of the attending doctor.
- Hospital: The name of the hospital where the patient was treated.
- Insurance Provider: The insurance provider covering the patient.
- Billing Amount: The total billing amount for the patient's hospital stay.
- Room Number: The room number where the patient was admitted.
- Admission Type: Whether the admission was urgent, elective, or emergency.
- Discharge Date: The date the patient was discharged from the hospital.
- Medication: The primary medication given to the patient.
- Test Results: The results of any tests conducted (e.g., Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive).
  
SQL Analysis

The analysis was performed using SQL queries to answer key questions, such as:

- Patient Distribution by Age and Gender: How are patients distributed across different age groups and genders?
- Medical Condition Prevalence: Which medical conditions are most common in the patient population?
- Billing Insights: What is the average billing amount for different medical conditions, and how does it vary by insurance provider?
- Hospital and Doctor Performance: How do patient outcomes vary across different hospitals and doctors?
- Admission and Discharge Trends: What are the trends in admission types, and how long are patients typically staying in the hospital?
  
Key Insights

Age and Gender Distribution:

Most patients fall within the age group of 30-50.
There is an even distribution of male and female patients across different conditions.
Medical Conditions:

- Cancer and obesity are the most prevalent medical conditions.
- Patients with diabetes show a higher rate of hospital readmission.

Billing Analysis:

-Average billing amounts vary significantly based on the patient's medical condition and hospital.
- Patients with cancer generally incur the highest bills, followed by those with diabetes.
  
Admission Trends:

- Most patients were admitted for emergency care, followed by urgent care cases.
- Elective admissions show shorter hospital stays on average compared to emergency admissions.
  
Tools Used
- SQL: For running queries and generating insights.
- Excel: For preliminary data cleaning and review.
